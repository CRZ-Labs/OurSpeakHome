# Our Speak Home

**News**: Worcome Studios re-design this project with the name of MyChatCMN (Jun 12, 2020).

## About

OurSpeakHome (OSH for friends), is a Windows program that allows the connection between several clients to a hosted TCP chat server.

The TCP chat has a public window (all users are connected to it and this is where the messages are posted for all clients) and also a private chat (this private chat is between clients. The Server cannot send private chats)

### The project

OSH was programmed in Visual Studio 2017 with the WinForms or VB.NET language.

It is currently being developed without the help of Worcome Studios, but they created a copy and added a database registration system. and they renamed it "MyChatCMN" with our consent.

Currently you can help us with some little things that we still can't add, it would be great.
